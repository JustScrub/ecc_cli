# Command Line Utility for Elliptic Curve Cryptography
An educational project to understand Elliptic Curve Cryptography on modulo fields.

Implements operations on elliptic curves and some cryptographic algorithms based on ECC.

DONE:
- EC Math
- Algorithms: ECDSA, ECDH, "ECIES"

TODO:
 - ECDSA in CLI
 - more benchmarks?
